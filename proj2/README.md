# Project 2 - TIPS

This project will give you intimate knowledge of cache logic through implementation of the actual caching logic. We will be providing you a MIPS simulator called TIPS (Thousands of Instructions Per Second), that will be able to run MIPS instructions. However, the cache logic is broken (read: conveniently non- existent)!
